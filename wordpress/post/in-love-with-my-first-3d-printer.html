<p>I was a bit skeptical and fearful that I'd buy something that would beat me, and then I'd have to confess to my friends that I failed. And that's why it took me sooo long to buy a 3D printer. Now they are cheap. Like 200usd cheap. And getting cheaper and easier to build every fucking day.
</p><p>
</p><p>So I read tutorials, blogs, youtube videos. The best the worst the ugly of chinese DIY kits and what's the best start a noob can have. Awesome internet has all the answers.
</p><p>
</p><p>No it doesn't.
</p><p><h2>Building a 3D printer</h2>
</p><p>When the package arrives, no matter how many (if any) reassurances you get from your peers. If you are not a mechanical engineer, is hard not to make any mistakes. Undo, redo... repeat. It feels like I'm describing it as a terrible thing... but actually it was super fun!
</p><p>
</p><p>It feels like a puzzle. It makes you feel some nice fluffy feeling about Engineering. It makes you feel smart when you figure it out. And it is fucking rewarding. <em>Damn</em>, I could not emphasise that enough.
</p><p>
</p><p>Building a 3D printer was rewarding in itself. Makes you think about all the trade-offs manufacturers have when trying to make the cheapest DIY 3D printer. And that, for me, made me discover my inner mechanical engineer child. Because when it's all build and done you can start making it awesome.
</p><p><h2>A do-it-all machine</h2>
</p><p>I always thought, "ok, but if I had a 3D printer, what would I print?". I thought I would get bored and stop printing after downloading a bunch of models and getting over it. But this is the thing... It wasn't about printing the things I wanted, it was the fact that by having the possibility of making any shape with "enough" resistance rewired my brain. I mean, I'm a coder, It shapes my reality lens. And this opens so many doors to "hack" in the real sense.
</p><p>
</p><p>I need an enclosure for ABS printing? Well, we can hack 2 IKEA tables, some 3d printed parts and Boom, an ABS enclosure.

</p><p><h2>How did I start?</h2>
</p><p>I chose the Tevo Tarantula after reading some online reviews. Youtube is your friend, and almost everything is explained there. I'm not going to be nice and tell you that glass is your friend. Because people must do their own mistakes. Is great. You learn.
</p><p>
</p><p>And to end this post. This is my baby, with enclosures, and some tacky leds.
