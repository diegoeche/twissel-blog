<p>Hello.
</p><p>
</p><p>My name is Diego. And I started studying computer science with high idealistic goals in my head. Creating robots, making true AI, cure hunger, destroy inequality. Create UTOPIA
</p><p>
</p><p>Then, working after a long time in what could be the most fun projects you see machines prevalence in the modern world has not been what we expected. We have created what many of the sci-fi writers warned us about automation. A constant and infuriating pollution of our environment by advertisers that try to brainwash us into consumption of goods that have no real value.
</p><p>
</p><p>Horrible things have been done in the name of "everybody else is doing it". You can't be a sheep. You should avoid it at all costs. Actually, Weizenbaum puts it perfectly:
</p><p><blockquote>“The salvation of the world depends only on the individual whose world it is. At least, every individual must act as if the whole future of the world, of humanity itself, depends on him. Anything less is a shirking of responsibility and is itself a dehumanizing force, for anything less encourages the individual to look upon himself as a mere actor in a drama written by anonymous agents, as less than a whole person, and that is the beginning of passivity and aimlessness.”
</p><p>― <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/496834.Joseph_Weizenbaum">Joseph Weizenbaum</a></blockquote>
</p><p>Well... I escaped 6 months to remember what computing is all about. I got tired of click-through rates. Abusing our mental bugs of irrationality. I want to rediscover what is fun about computers. How they help us understand ourselves and how they can be carriers of disruption for better times to come.</p>
