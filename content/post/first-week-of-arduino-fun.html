<p>So I remember my love for Electronics when I started my university.
</p><p>
</p><p>The problem of hardware is having stupid and idiotic hands. Burning stuff. Buying things... or is that actually the fun? :D
</p><p>
</p><p>Things have changed a lot from my PIC programming lessons in my Uni. Lot of Amateur friendly hardware is out there, and is not only cheap. Is rather modular!
</p><p>
</p><p>So I got <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Anf%C3%A4ngerset-UNO-f%C3%BCr-Arduino-Mikrocontroller/dp/B00CR1FAS2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447254589&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=funduino+uno+1">a simple kit</a> to remember even the polarity of a LED. And it has been lot's of fun!
</p><p>
</p><p>I started with a simple 2 bit counter operated by a single button. Then motivation got me to even make a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9n-vExM2Kp/">cool ultrasonic distance measurer</a>. And since I got already all that working. Why not bragging of the beautiful weather in Medellin by creating a simple serial-connected sensor to my laptop and making a nice plot to prove it?
</p><p>
</p><p>First, get a cheap temperature sensor like <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10988">this one</a>.
</p><p>
</p><p>Second. <a href="https://gist.github.com/diegoeche/3c63b2fa93a2f8ec4d98">Create a simple snippet of code</a> and load it into the Arduino to measure the temperature. I average 10 consecutive measurements to avoid too much noise:
</p><p>
</p><p>The Arduino will start writing to the serial port the temperature in Celcius. You only need to read the value and plot it against time. <a href="https://gist.github.com/diegoeche/24fe5d3ef5d95484d511">I used a simple ruby script like the following to do so</a>.
</p><p>
</p><p>A couple of hours of sensing shows that I'm happy not to endure winter in Berlin this time :D
