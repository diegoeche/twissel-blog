<p>After many failed little pet projects I finally started to work on a simple game. Tired of the failures of half-assed abstractions and poorly supported cross-platform languages I decided I could just learn C++.
</p><p>
</p><p>I must say that after 3 months I'm really happy on the progress I've so far.
</p><p><h3>Tooling</h3>
</p><p>So far, I've been bootstrapping  a simple map editor with <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a> (Graphics, Sound libraries). And <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">imgui</a> (For the Map Editor and debugging tools). I've been inspired by the simplicity of <a href="https://eliasdaler.github.io/">Elias Daler's game</a>.
</p><p>
</p><p>Contrary to everybody else's opinion (maybe I'm surrounded by C++ haters) I'm greatly surprised by how nice is to do C++ in my evenings after work. Last time I used it (and maybe I'll sound like an old timer) memory was handled by yourself and g++ errors weren't very friendly to the beginner. Clang and C++ 11 makes everything easier! SFML is also a great example of modern C++.
</p><p>
</p><p>I'd love to share the existing code, but is nice to be able to move fast without the feeling people will judge you for your awful hacks. (Hey! I gotta write clean code for my daily job!)
</p><p>
</p><p>For the assets I've been using the help from The <a href="http://kenney.nl/">Asset-God</a> (as known in /r/gamedev)
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway... here's a small demo of the small interactions I have so far.
